# ESP32-NTP-Time-Synchronization-with-WiFi
This project demonstrates how to connect an ESP32 to a WiFi network and synchronize its internal clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP). The ESP32 obtains accurate local time from an NTP server, displays the current time via Serial output, and then disconnects from WiFi to save power.
